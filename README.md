# Pacman Project

## Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Pacman using Python and Pygame. It captures the nostalgic gameplay of the original game, including maze navigation, pellet collection, ghost evasion, and power-ups.

Features

Classic Gameplay: Enjoy an authentic Pacman experience.
Intelligent Ghosts: Includes multiple ghosts with simple AI behavior.
Maze Navigation: Designed maze with walls, pellets, and power-ups.
Scoring System: Earn points by collecting pellets and eating ghosts when powered up.
Responsive Controls: Use keyboard input to guide Pacman through the maze.

## DQN with Convolutional Neural Networks
Developed a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch. The agent was trained in the ALE/MsPacman-v5 environment (via Gymnasium) for 12 hours, ultimately achieving a high score of 4000.

Technical Stack: Python, PyTorch, Gymnasium, ALE
